//As in JavaScript, all numbers in TypeScript are either floating point values
//These floating point numbers get the type number, while BigIntegers get the type bigint.
//In addition to hexadecimal and decimal literals, TypeScript also supports binary and octal literals introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
